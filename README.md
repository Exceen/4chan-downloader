4chan-downloader
================

Python script that downloads the images of a whole 4chan thread. The script
runs from the commandline interface asking you the URL of the thread.

Place the whole directory anywhere on your computer and just run the
download.py. The script will explain itself from there on.
To start the script you have to type the following command:
python download.py

You can find the downloaded images in the ./download folder.
